--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- New bug: In Classic levels, captured stones disappear. It's probably because 
they are indicated as being dead, aka their cell being null instead of the 
first cell of the track (the homebase).

- Old bug: There's something wrong with Wrath. As if it sometimes cannot move, 
although technically there's a cell available.
