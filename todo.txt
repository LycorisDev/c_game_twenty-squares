--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Stones all virtually start one cell before the first one. The issue though is 
that now the first movement of a stone is `dice - 1`. Make it so that the first 
cell (aka the one before the actual first one) is not considered. It's not part 
of the board, it represents the homebase.

- There's something wrong with Wrath. As if it sometimes cannot move, although 
technically there's a cell available.
