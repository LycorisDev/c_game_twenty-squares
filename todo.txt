--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- There's something wrong with Wrath. As if it sometimes cannot move, although 
technically there's a cell available. But after a thorough exploration of the 
codebase, it's too chaotic for me to fix the issue. It requires a refactoring 
now, not later.

- Make the board cells smaller and maybe more square instead of rectangular.

- Query Classic stones with a number input instead of a word: `1` vs `one`.
- Query for Deadly Sins stones with the following letters:
	- Lust (L)
	- Pride (P)
	- Gluttony (GL)
	- Sloth (S)
	- Envy (E)
	- Wrath (W)
	- Greed (GR)

- Allow two human players, instead of always playing against the computer.
